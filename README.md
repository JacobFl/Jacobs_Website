# Jacobs_Website
This is my attempt to make a personal website.
Although I do know how to code in HTML/CSS from CSCI 4131 - Internet Programming, why try and figure out how to make a professional website when I can follow a 
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs). 
I have realized that this is not much but every tree bust start from a seed.
